VisionAI: Advanced Assistive System for the Visually Impaired
Introduction
VisionAI is a pioneering project aimed at enhancing the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals through a real-time assistive system. Utilizing advanced object detection technologies and real-time audio feedback mechanisms, this system is specifically tailored to navigate the challenging road conditions in India.

Project Overview
The VisionAI system integrates cutting-edge technologies such as YOLOv8 for object detection and Raspberry Pi for on-device processing, providing auditory feedback to the user via a connected mobile device. This assistive technology is designed to identify potential obstacles and communicate essential navigation cues to visually impaired users, thereby aiding their ability to navigate safely and independently in various environments.

Key Features
Object Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv8 algorithm to detect and identify obstacles in real-time.
Real-Time Audio Feedback: Offers immediate guidance based on the surrounding environment through audio instructions.
Customized for Indian Conditions: Tailored to address the unique challenges posed by Indian road and traffic conditions.
Portable and User-Friendly: Implemented on a Raspberry Pi, ensuring the system is both lightweight and easy to carry.
System Components
Raspberry Pi 4: Acts as the central processing unit, running the object detection model and handling data transmission.
Sony IMX219 Camera Sensor: Captures high-resolution images of the environment, which are then processed by the Raspberry Pi.
Mobile Integration: Connects to a mobile application that processes the detected data and converts it into navigational audio cues.
Usage
Setup: Attach the camera sensor to the Raspberry Pi and ensure it is connected to the mobile application.
Operation: Power on the device as you begin to move. The camera will continuously scan the surroundings.
Navigation: Listen to the audio cues provided by the mobile application for guidance on obstacles and safe paths.
Impact
VisionAI aims to significantly enhance the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by providing a reliable and intuitive navigation aid. By reducing dependence on human assistance, this project empowers users to navigate more confidently and independently.
